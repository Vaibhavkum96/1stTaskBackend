I have written all the API using standard practices, For authentication and authorization, we have use JWT WeB Token modules.
For Authentication: I have create a Register and Login Module to handle this task. 
For Authorization : I have written the logic that only a user who is authorized for his account can edit/delete his account details. No other user except admin can interfare with the details of a particulat user.
Business Logic of API are written in Controllers, Db Models are defined in models. 
Tested all the API's with the help of POSTMAN.
